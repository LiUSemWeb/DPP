# DPP
Digital Product Passport ontology

This is the GitHub Repository of the DPP ontology project, aiming to analyse requirements and potential of a highly modular DPP ontology, i.e. an ontology network. The ontology modules can be found under the ontology catalogue, and accompanying SHACL shapes under the shacl catalogue. The requirements of the ontology network are in the docs catalogue, and unit tests based on the ontology Competency Questions are in the sparql folder. 

Please note that the ontology network is under development and might still change considerably. Next steps involve alignments to other ontologies, including the CEON ODPs.
